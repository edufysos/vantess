## 4. Assess the desirability of SoS variants

We assigned a score for each variability of Education SoS, as shown below:

The table below shows for each CS type involved in the Educational SoS, the available CS instances identified during the CS recognition phase, along with their cost, estimated simply on a [1-10] scale.

***Vania: include all 16 SoSs?***

After computing the benefits and the expected cost of implement each SoS variant, we can calculate the desirability scores of the SoS variants, as shown below

***Vania: include the desirability scores for all 16 SoSs?***

SoS 2 results to be the selected SoS variant since it has the highest desirability equal to 12.5. Moodle and Google Calendar are then chosen as reference implementations for LMS and CS respectively for the SoS 2 realisation.

## 5. Derive a simulation model for selected SoS

## 6. Test objectives derivation

## 7. Test scenarios generation

## 8. Test case generation
