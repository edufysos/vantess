# About

This is the companion repository for the paper "Designing and Testing Systems of Systems: From Variability Models to Test Cases passing through Desirability Assessment".

# Approach

VANTES (VAriability aware-desigN and TEsting of SoS) is a methodology that provides a variability-aware-design and testing approach of SoSs, supporting the SoS engineer to assure that the SoS requirements are fulfilled and the SoS architecture can be easily maintained. More detailed artifacts used in the article can be found below:


## 4. Assess the desirability of SoS variants

The complete desirability scores can be found [here](./artifacts/SoSDesirability.xlsx).

## 5. Derive a simulation model for selected SoS

A more detailed UCTS can be found [here](./images/SoSUCTS.png).
## 7. Test scenarios generation

More sequence diagrams can be found in artifacts/sequences.

## 8. Executable test cases

The test cases can be found at artifacts/test in VANTESS Repository. Instructions on how to configure the constituent systems can be found in the [EDUFYSoS repository](https://github.com/edufysos/edufysos), more specifically [here](https://github.com/edufysos/edufysos/blob/master/guidelines/BasicEducationalSoS.pdf).
